# Ouzo
Proof that 20 glasses of Ouzo don't matter based on the principle of Mathematical Induction.

I read the proof and I'm not fully convinced, so I created a branch which includes a picture as a counterexample.   

Ok, I saw your counterexample picture. It is convincing me. Let's merge it to main. THen we look for the gap in my proof.  

Just added a short dataset describing Math Induction with some detail. Maybe there is a hint what is wrong with the proof.

Ok, I will check it.

Now I've got it. The Induction base isn't always 1, e.g. in proposition 2 to the n > 2 times n, where the induction base works with all numbers n > 3. In our Ouzo case it is maybe 3 or 4. Induction base will fail with all base numbers n > 4 and thus the whole proof. 
Corollary: Be careful with Ouzo!
This finishes our proof event
